git-test
========

Trying GIT to see how things work. Something I am considering using for a couple of projects. Could make for more interesting and streamlined method of working together.

This is a test to see the changes from home compared to sync at work along with other locations. This really might be the best way to handle files as we all work with local files compared to network shares. Files are then committed to the server for everyone to work on and have updated files.
